## 📝 Description

This repository contains a collection of academic projects/tests developed for the **Topics in Mathematics I & II** courses. The work focuses on applying fundamental mathematical concepts—such as function analysis, numerical methods, and regression—to solve practical problems using **MATLAB**, supplemented by Word and Excel for reporting and initial data handling.

## 🎓 Project Context

These projects were completed during the 1st and 2nd semesters of the 2021/2022 academic year as part of the **[Licenciatura em Ciência de Dados](https://www.iscte-iul.pt/degree/code/0322/bachelor-degree-in-data-science)** (*Bachelor Degree in Data Science*) at **ISCTE-IUL**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📚 Project Breakdown

This repository is divided into the work from each of the two courses.

## 📐 Tópicos de Matemática I

This course focused on the fundamentals of calculus and numerical analysis.

### 📝 1st Project: Function Analysis & Root Finding

The primary goal was to perform a comprehensive study of a given mathematical function.

**Key Concepts Applied:**
*   **Function Graphing:** Creating detailed and understandable graphical representations in MATLAB.
*   **Fixed-Point Iteration:** Proving the existence of a fixed point within a given interval and determining its value numerically.
*   **Newton-Raphson Method:** Applying this iterative method to find the root (zero) of the function.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Commenting on the results and convergence speed of both root-finding methods.

### 🔢 2nd Project: Numerical Integration & Differentiation

This assignment focused on applying numerical methods to calculate integrals and derivatives when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible.

**Key Concepts Applied:**
*   **Numerical Integration:** Using the **Midpoint Rule** and **Trapezoid Rule** to approximate definite integrals with a specified error margin.
*   **Maclaurin Series:** Developing a Maclaurin polynomial to approximate a function and then integrating the polynomial as a proxy for the original function.
*   **Numerical Differentiation:** Calculating the first and second derivatives at specific points using the second-order **divided differences** method.
*   **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Comparing numerical results with exact values obtained via the FTC to assess accuracy.

## 📊 Tópicos de Matemática II

This course built upon the first, introducing concepts of linear algebra and regression modeling.

### 📉 Ficha Prática: Linear, Exponential, and Polynomial Regression

This practical worksheet involved implementing regression models from scratch to fit data, with a specific focus on analyzing COVID-19 daily new case data.

**Key Concepts Applied:**
*   **Linear Regression (Least Squares):** Implementing the matrix formula `β = (ZᵀZ)⁻¹(ZᵀY)` to find the best-fit line for a given set of data points.
*   **Exponential Regression:** Using a change of variables (logarithms) to transform an exponential model (`y = e^(mx+b)`) into a linear one (`ln(y) = mx + b`) and applying the least squares method.
*   **Polynomial Regression:** Extending the regression model to fit polynomials of a given degree `k` to the data, demonstrating how to model non-linear trends.
*   **Model Optimization:** Determining the optimal number of parameters (polynomial degree) to minimize the total squared error, finding the best balance between fit and complexity.
